# MyGitCheatSheet

I created this Git cheat sheet because I needed a reference that includes not only the usual commands, but also some less common ones I use frequently â€“ especially **submodule commands**.  

It's a compact, printable PDF designed for quick access while working on multiple projects. [Based on this](https://doabledanny.gumroad.com/l/git-commands-cheat-sheet-pdf)
